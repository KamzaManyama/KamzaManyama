#  Hi, I’m Maredi Speel Manyama

I'm a passionate Full-Stack Developer and Frontend Enthusiast based in Midrand, South Africa. I specialize in building scalable, performant, and user-friendly web applications with clean, maintainable code.

I love crafting intuitive user interfaces and seamless user experiences that solve real-world problems — all while continuously learning and growing in the world of modern web development.

With 1 year of hands-on experience, I’ve had the privilege of working across different environments:

- **6-month internship at MPHOTI CONSULTING, where I strengthened my foundation in software development and real-world project execution.**

- **Currently consulting at Sunbet, contributing to ongoing development, maintenance, and enhancements of enterprise-level systems.**
